# AmigaOS-ClassAction
The source code of ClassAction for Amiga I wrote between 1992 and 1998

**ClassAction_2.8 folder** is for the latest AmigaOS 1.3+ version


**ClassAction_3.X folder** is for the AmigaOS 2.0+, MUI version

[Dice C compiler](https://aminet.net/package/dev/c/dice-3.16) is required to compile.
